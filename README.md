# Automated-Prediction-of-Income-from-Farming-of-a-Commodity-An-ARIMA-based-Framework
In this project, an efficient ARIMA-based framework is proposed for predicting farmersâ€™ income for future years.  The major focus of the proposed work is to determine the best suitable variation of ARIMA model, were the ACF and PACF plots are used to find the coefficients of the ARIMA method.
